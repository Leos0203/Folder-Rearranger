# Folder-Rearranger
A quick project which gets a directory in my case that was just my 'Downloads' folder.
Then gets all the files and stores them in a list.
Then gets the file type from the file path.
And creates a folder for every type of file.
Then moves all the files to their corresponding folder.
But if a folder exists with the same name then we simply skip over this step.
The program also checks if there's no file type (which means that the file either has no file type or is just a folder) and doesn't create anything.
